Here is the following explanation of the application itself and some code explanation because some parts are kinda difficult to understand at first sight. 
I wanted to code the application in such a dynamic way, so if the json are getting extended I don't have to go into the code and change anything.

My task was to code a recipe cookbook that is receiving to files --> "ingredients.json" and "recipes.json"

These two files are in this repository available.

The first thing what you will see after starting the application is this window. 

At first I'm asking for the user's input in three cases:

The first one is just looking at all available recipes!

The second one is retrieving the ingredients for a specified recipe!

The last one is searching the recipes that contain specified ingredients!
